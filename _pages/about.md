**News**
======
I am conducting a usability study to identify physiciansâ€™ needs and requirements of explainable AI. If you're interested in participate, please contact me.


## Weina's bio
======
Hi, I'm Weina. I'm a PhD student working on **interpretable artificial intelligence (AI)**, and how to use it to augment doctors' **clinical decision making**. It is interdisciplinary research among AI, computer vision, information visualization (InfoVis), human-computer interaction (HCI), and medicine. An explanation is a two-way communication/interaction between AI system and its users, that's where HCI and InfoVis come in. I'm also interested in using explanations for better learning, for both AI (enable AI to learn better by forcing explicit representation) and doctors (learn from those explicit representations to accumulate experience from big clinical data).

Previous I received my **Doctor of Medicine (MD)** degree and had worked in both the hospital and pharmaceutical industry. Now besides my research in training and making sense of artificial intelligence, in my life I am engaged in training and understanding natural intelligence, and writing science fictions.
