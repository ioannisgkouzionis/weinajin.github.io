**News**

I am conducting a [Doctor AI usability study][31331d16] to understand physiciansâ€™ needs and requirements of explainable AI. If you are a **physician** and are interested in participating, please feel free to contact me.

## About Weina

Hi, I'm Weina. I'm a PhD student working on **interpretable AI (artificial intelligence)**, and how to use it to augment doctors' **clinical decision making** based on **medical image** tasks.
<!-- It is interdisciplinary research among AI, computer vision, information visualization (InfoVis), human-computer interaction (HCI), and medicine. An explanation is a two-way communication/interaction between AI system and its users, that's where HCI and InfoVis come in. -->
I'm especially interested in using explanations for better learning, for both AI (enable AI to learn better by forcing explicit representation) and doctors (learn from those explicit representations to accumulate experience from big clinical data).

Previous I received my **Doctor of Medicine (MD)** degree and had worked in the hospital, pharmaceutical and tech company. Now besides my research in training and making sense of artificial intelligence, in my life I am engaged in training and understanding natural intelligence, and writing science fictions.

  - It summarizes the recent technical advances to overcome the practical challenges of applying AI to glioma imaging.
  - These challenges involve the full life-cycle of developing an AI model, from obtaining the training data, to training the AI models, to evaluating and deploying the AI model to clinical settings.
  - These efforts aim to make the AI-based tools to be fully implemented in neuro-oncology to significantly improve the care of patients with gliomas.
