As a review paper, this is a high-level overview of the recent advances in deep learning. It introduced the idea of multilayer neural networks, backpropagation, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and the advances they brought to computer vision and language processing. The key advantage of deep learning is that it avoids the number of engineering skills and domain expertise when extracting good features. The features are "learned automatically using a general-purpose learning procedure". It also summarized 4 key ideas behind ConvNets: local connections, shared weights, pooling, and the use of many layers. I gained a new understanding of the pooling part: its role is to "merge semantically similar features into one, because the relative positions of the features forming a motif can vary somewhat, reliably detecting the motif can be done by coarse-graining the position of each feature". Pooling also creates "an invariance to small shifts and distortions".

Given its publication year of 2015, for someone who already familiar with deep learning, this paper did not add on too much additional information. However, since his paper is written by LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G, and has received 8k+ citations (published in *Nature*), it is worth taking a look, especially it introduced the changes of research from a historical perspective. For those who have little machine learning background, this paper is quite easy to read and do not hinder the reader with profound mathematical formulas.
