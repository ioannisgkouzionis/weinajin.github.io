## General deep learning

- LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G. (2015). Deep learning. Nature, 521(7553), 436–444. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14539

As a review paper, this is a high-level overview of the recent advances in deep learning. It introduced the idea of multilayer neural networks, backpropagation, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and the advances they brought to computer vision and language processing. The key advantage of deep learning is that it avoids the number of engineering skills and domain expertise when extracting good features. The features are "learned automatically using a general-purpose learning procedure". It also summarized 4 key ideas behind ConvNets: local connections, shared weights, pooling, and the use of many layers. I gained a new understanding of the pooling part: its role is to "merge semantically similar features into one, because the relative positions of the features forming a motif can vary somewhat, reliably detecting the motif can be done by coarse-graining the position of each feature". Pooling also creates "an invariance to small shifts and distortions".

Given its publication year of 2015, for someone who already familiar with deep learning, this paper did not add on too much additional information. However, since his paper is written by LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G, and has received 8k+ citations (published in *Nature*), it is worth taking a look, especially it introduced the changes of research from a historical perspective. For those who have little machine learning background, this paper is quite easy to read and do not hinder the reader with profound mathematical formulas.



## Machine learning in healthcare

This paper highlights the recent progress of deep learning in the application filed of clinical imaging, electronic health records, genomics, and sensory data. Noticeably, it listed challenges and opportunities within the domain: data integration(integrating heterogeneous data source, and also incorporating expert knowledge), interpretability, security, and temporal modeling. It also pointed out that deep learning can serve as a "guiding principle to organize both hypothesis-driven research and exploratory investigation(eg: clustering, visualization of patient cohorts, stratification of disease populations).

This is a more technique-focused review paper published in IEEE. The graphs well-demonstrated the distribution of papers in the subfields of medical imaging, medical informatics, bioinformatics, sensing, and public health. It also gave percentage most used deep learning methods in health informatics: with recurrent neural network, ConvNets, and deep neural network leading the majority, followed by deep belief network, deep boltzmann machine, and deep autoencoder. It addressed similar challenges include:
1. model not interpretable
2. disease-specific data is often limited
3. needs preprocessing; hyperparameter searching is a blind exploration
4. machine learning models are susceptible to be manipulated

Written by two MDs, the NEJM perspective article introduced the machine learning statistical method to doctors at a high level. What is machine learning? What can machine learning do? What kind of data does machine learning algorithm need? And what is the limitation of machine learning? With the ability to transform data into knowledge, what area in medicine will be disrupted by machine learning? The authors pointed out three directions: 1) prognosis estimation, 2) radiology and anatomical pathology; and 3) the improvement in diagnostic accuracy.

I personally really like this article. Let me quote the last paragraph:

> Clinical medicine has always required doctors to handle enormous amounts of data, from macro-level physiology and behavior to laboratory and imaging studies and, increasingly, “omic” data. The ability to manage this complexity has always set good doctors apart from the rest. Machine learning will become an indispensable tool for clinicians seeking to truly understand their patients. As patients’ conditions and medical technologies become more complex, the role of machine learning will grow, and clinical medicine will be challenged to grow with it. As in other industries, this challenge will create winners and losers in medicine. But we are optimistic that patients, whose lives and medical histories shape the algorithms, will emerge as the biggest winners as machine learning transforms clinical medicine.

It is another medical-focused review written by neurologists. The highlight in it is that it listed researches using machine learning for the detection and treatment of neurological diseases, mainly for stroke. However, some of the statements in this paper were a bit arbitrary, for example, the achievement of some ML system it referred was from news report rather than research papers which underwent certain experiment and evaluation. This is a way reflects that clinicians tended to hold a believe-or-not attitude. The lack of critical thinking for some media news may root from that the doctors know little about the underlying technologies of deep learning.
