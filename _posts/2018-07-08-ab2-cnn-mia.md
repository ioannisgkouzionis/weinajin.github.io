The task of medical imaging localization is to identify lesions' location, i.e.: classify each pixel to be the lesion or not. The previous sliding-window approach is usually computational slow and redundant, because divides the whole image into small patches and runs each patch separately through the CNN. It also through away the context information. U-net built upon the fully convolutional network (fCNN). With the fCNN, it outputs a segmentation map. The model architecture consists of a contracting path (downsampling) to capture context, and a symmetric expanding path (upsampling) for precise localization. Therefore it yields a u-shaped architecture. The upsampling part also concatenates the corresponding part from the downsampling with the skip-connection. The results showed it preforms significantly better than the sliding-window convolutional network on different biomedical segmentation tasks.
