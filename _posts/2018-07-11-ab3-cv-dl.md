## Novel deep learning architectures

The aim of the paper is to model functions of proteins in specific human tissues in the protein-protein interaction network. Previous works ignore and could not differentiate the protein functions in different tissues. This paper present *OhmNet*, which learns features of protein functions in a protein-protein interaction network with an unsupervised learning fashion of node2vec embedding. It encourages sharing of similar features among proteins with similar network neighborhoods. To reserve the hierarchical relationship of proteins in different tissues, the model uses mathematical regularization to express the fact that the proteins "stay together functions similar". Specifically, it incorporates a recursive structure into the regularization that enforces the proteins to have similar features of the same proteins in the parent layer. The results showed *OhmNet* provided more accurate predictions of cellular function than alternative approaches, and also generated more accurate hypotheses about tissue-specific protein actions.
