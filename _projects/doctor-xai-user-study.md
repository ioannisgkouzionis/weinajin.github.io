This is an ongoing study in 2019. From the study, I aim to generate a thorough understanding of the specific needs and requirements of explainable AI from healthcare professionals. I hope the findings from our study will inform researchers in the medicine, AI, and human-computer interaction community to have a clearer idea about the end-users’ requirements, could ask more specific research questions that tailor to clinical needs, and design AI systems that better support healthcare professionals’ clinical thinking process.
