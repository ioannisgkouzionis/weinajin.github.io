Convolutional layer is the basic and main building block of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). I recently began to understand more about the convolution computing after a long path. One of my recent question is:

> For the input layer, how do I convolute the RGB color image?

Unlike the grayscale image which is a matrix,
